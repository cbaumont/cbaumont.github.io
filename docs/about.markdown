Bem-vindos!

I am a Brazilian living in the UK. I've been [working](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baumont/) in tech for the last 10 years, for a number of different roles & industries. Learned a lot of good and (possibly more) bad things. In this blog, I want to bring them all into discussion.

Join me in this journey of self discovery as I explore the ever-evolving world of tech, the universe, and beyond!
